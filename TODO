# Ideas and To-Do

- [] Refactor Solver to output vector of heads/flows instead of in-place assignment
- [] Refactor network, link and node setup, compute coefficients using traits
- [] Parallelize sequential solves with Rayon if possible (no tanks)
- [] Implement Darcy Weisbach
- [] Implement Valves and Pumps
