# Ideas and To-Do

- [x] Refactor Solver to output vector of heads/flows instead of in-place assignment (allow parallization of solve loop)
- [x] Parallelize sequential solves with Rayon if possible (no tanks)
- [x] Refactor network build from inp file, split logic into separate methods
- [x] Refactor network, link and node setup, split into separate files and compute coefficients using traits
- [] Setup unit conversion for links and nodes
- [] Input file support for PATTERN, TIMES, OPTIONS
- [] Implement unit conversion
- [] Implement Darcy Weisbach
- [] Implement Valves and Pumps
- [] Implement tank logic
- [] Try to get the solver working for f32 in addition to f64 (SIMD speedup)
- [] Setup unit testing
- [] Setup automated benchmarks
